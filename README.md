# Debugging_FizzBuzz
 
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Read this the code in main.py</li>
	<li>Spot the problems.</li>
	<li>Modify the code to fix the program.</li>
	<li>No shortcuts - don't copy-paste to replace the code entirely with a working solution.</li>
	<li>The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.</li>
	<li>When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print 
	"Fizz".</li>
	<li>When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print 
	"Buzz".</li>
	<li>And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it 
	should print "FizzBuzz"</li>
</ol>
